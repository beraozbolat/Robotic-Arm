# Robotic-Arm
My name is Ahmet Bera Özbolat and this is my term project for EEE-212 course
I have used FRDM-KL25z board   it has an ARM® Cortex™-M0+ processor.
It's a robotic arm that is controlled by 2 joystick.
I have used peripheral ADC to get values from joysticks and use it to produce PWM signals using Timer modules on board.
Here is my youtube video which presents the related project: https://youtu.be/yLu6ZBU8Zb0.
